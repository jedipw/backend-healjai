This project is the functional implementation of the backend logic used on a different platform. The code is written in Node.js, Express, and Websocket.io. Here is a list of the functions that are currently functional:
1. Authentication (Register)
2. HealTalk (Chat psychiatrists)

## 2. First time setup
### A.) Normal setup:
1. Run `npm i` in terminal
2. Run `npm start` in terminal

### B.) Developer setup:
##### Set up the backend server(choose one method):
- Use your own machine to run the backend server:  
  1. Run `npm i` in terminal
  2. Run `npm i -g nodemon` in terminal
  3. Run `npm start` in terminal  
(Note: If you use your own machine to run the backend server, don't forget to change the path first; see the installation manual in README.md of HealJai.)
